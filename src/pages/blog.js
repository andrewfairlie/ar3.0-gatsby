                    How the ups and downs experiences from this year made the

                        this reflection, then just stop. If you’re expecting a
                        throwback of good memories, or to see if I’m thanking
                        some people and saying I love them or whatever bullshit,

                        for ME, about me. But I decided to share it to people I
                        care about, OR , I just happen to talk to you and wanted
                        to share it with you, in hopes of getting some
                        unsolicited advice or feedback.

                    If I could choose a word to describe my year, it would be{' '}
                    <span class="smcp">rollercoaster</span>. Not because I took
                    my first, actual, rollercoaster in my life, but because it
                    is a metaphor to reflect the ups and downs in my life in the
                    year of 2018. I mean, the rollercoaster experience COULD be
                    categorised in the 'up' category, I guess.
                </p>
                <h3>How I started 2018</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I started the year off in Jakarta, Indonesia, in a
                    small province, if that’s the correct word to use, called{' '}
                    <em>Jalan Karbela Selatan</em> which translates to South
                    Karbela Road. At midnight, I was at the top of my{' '}
                    <em>kost</em> (rental flat) with some of my friends from{' '}
                    <span class="smcp-caps">Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s</span> (NP){' '}
                    <span class="smcp-caps">
                        Global Entrepreneurship Internship Programme
                    </span>
                    (GEIP). We were all mentioning to each other how that was
                    the first time we have experienced a New Year outside of
                    Singapore in our lives. When everybody was recording and
                    celebrating, I had that small little shake in my heart which
                    told me that 2018 was going to be a hell of a year for me.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        I had that small little shake in my heart that told me
                        that 2018 was going to be a hell of a year for me.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Fast forward 12 months, that small prophecy was indeed true.
                    It was an amazing year, no doubt, but it was a tough one.
                    Toughest I have ever had. But that’s okay, because with all
                    those shitty stuff I experienced, I learned a lot of
                    lessons, lessons that I shall reflect upon and remind myself
                    so I’ll never have to repeat the same mistakes again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I can truly and fully admit that’s wrong with me
                    this year is my absolute lack of self-belief, a dropping
                    confidence, and a surprisingly substantial amount of
                    insecurities. It’s mostly these three things that have led
                    me to my own demise in the year of 2018.
                </p>
                <h3>The lack of self-belief</h3>
                <p>
                    My lack of self-belief is extremely unnoticeable, if you
                    know me and see me often. I always tend to spread and
                    advocate self-belief by doing things like sharing your
                    design works, no matter how ugly you know they are, or
                    showing off my talents and such. But deep inside, my brain
                    often tells me that I’m not good enough, I’m disposable,
                    that there are thousands of people better than me at the
                    best thing I do, and more. It destroyed my self-esteem,
                    makes me easily anxious in public, and it makes me blame
                    myself for everything that’s wrong happening in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One major event in 2018 that I almost screwed up due to this
                    was when I was working with{' '}
                    <a
                        href="https://edenspiekermann.com/"
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                        <span class="smcp">Eden Spiekermann</span>
                    </a>
                    , a creative agency, working on SingPost's{' '}
                    <em>160 Years of Post</em> microsite. The agency had me
                    doing things that I didn’t expect myself to know and it was
                    tough trying to learn and catch up and keep to the deadline.
                    My self-belief was at the lowest because I just can’t
                    achieve a certain effect, style or function which the
                    founder of <span class="smcp">Eden Spiekermann</span>{' '}
                    himself requested, as part of a better user experience, in
                    which I truly believe in. Hence, with all those variables
                    adding up, I felt absolutely distraught, killing myself
                    inside repeatedly, and a voice in my head telling me I’m no
                    good, that I shouldn’t do web developing in the future, and
                    all other evil thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My lack of self-belief also made me have abandonment issues,
                    because I’m simply scared that I’m not good enough for my
                    friends and that I don’t fit in. I’m still working on my
                    self-belief, and hopefully 2019 will be a better year where
                    I can truly believe in myself to the point no one or no
                    thoughts can change what I think about myself.
                </p>
                <h3>Lack of confidence</h3>
                <p>
                    I never had confidence throughout my whole life. I do, as
                    what they call it, &lsquo;fake it 'til you make it&rsquo;.
                    Surprisingly, it works, and it has helped me throughout my
                    life. This year however, I became more conscious of myself
                    (probably due the lack of self-belief), and thus I fake my
                    confidence less. As I was trying to find an internship job
                    after graduation, there was a number of interviews that I
                    went through with zero confidence and it caused me the job.
                    I was never confident enough to confess to someone, never
                    confident enough to stay in a relationship, and never
                    confident enough to be… better. I felt that confidence had
                    something to do with a person’s betterment of themselves.
                    And if you don’t have confidence, it’s hard to be better. I
                    never realised how important being confident is to me until
                    I lost someone very important to me because I was underly
                    confident of myself and that I shared too much of my sad
                    stories and confided to her in hopes of becoming confident
                    from her encouragement and affection. I learned that
                    confidence is not dependent on anyone. It’s only dependent
                    on myself, and only I have the power to control it.
                </p>
                <h3>Insecurities</h3>
                <p>
                    I could talk about my insecurities in a 3000-word essay, but
                    I’ll summarise it here. I never knew that I was easily
                    jealous, easily competitive, and easily egoistic. Jealousy
                    is a <strong>very</strong> surprising insecurity to me
                    because I never thought I’d be so jealous to a toxic level.
                    Jealousy is healthy up to only a certain level. It helps you
                    protect people you love, and the things you’d do for them
                    because you're a little bit jealous may even get them out of
                    a bad situation, but my level of jealousy can honestly be
                    classified toxic. I was very jealous of people who were
                    talking to my date, even my close guy friends. I never let
                    it out, because I was so afraid of myself when I realised
                    how much jealousy I have and how little control I have over
                    it. It’s truly one of the deadly seven sins. After I broke
                    up with her, I realised I need to stop being jealous and
                    insecure, and it really does link up with my other wrongs in
                    me like lack of self-belief and confidence that probably
                    enhanced that jealousy in me that I had for a period of
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also very competitive especially because I lived for 5
                    months with a guy who probably has 5 almost 6 digits in his
                    bank account in Jakarta. I am extremely happy for him, and
                    this is the truth, and honest truth, but I was so
                    competitive that before my internship ended in February I
                    started devising plans to create an idea or a startup to
                    match his achievements. It only lasted for a month or two,
                    but I was absolutely terrified of myself after knowing what
                    kind of insecure piece of shit I am that I can’t be inferior
                    to another person for once. I learned that my ego is that
                    high that I simply can’t let someone be better than me, and
                    this is one of the most important things I have to get rid
                    of in 2018.
                </p>
                <h3>Realisation</h3>
                <p>
                    So, yeap. I really was a man with mistakes in 2018. It was
                    only on Christmas did I reflect, in my bunk bed at{' '}
                    <span class="smcp">
                        Tekong BMTC School 1, Cougar company line, level 5, bunk
                        3, bed 2
                    </span>
                    , that I have to be a better person in 2019. If anyone was
                    wondering, I’ve never done this kind of reflection before in
                    my life. But along with all the bad things, I’d like to end
                    my reflection with a couple of good ones.
                </p>
                <h3>Getting into a Relationship</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the highlights was getting into a relationship… sort
                    of. It was a bad relationship, because I got hurt a lot, and
                    I realised I’m trash, but I dated someone! I’ve never dated
                    someone before in my life. I really liked her. I was happy
                    with her. We spent good time during our dates, ate good
                    food, explored some places, and even went overseas together
                    (actually it’s just JB)! It lasted only 5 months, but I
                    learned a lot from it. I truly knew why people call us trash
                    because I truly realised how much of an asshole I was at
                    times with her. She didn’t deserve it. As heartbroken as I
                    am, I’m glad we ended the dating thing because she deserves
                    someone better and that person is not me. And with the state
                    I’m in, I have to be a better person and fix my
                    aforementioned problems first before I ever even consider
                    getting into a relationship. If you’re reading this, know
                    that you’ll always have a special place in my heart, and for
                    the sake of the betterment of myself, I’ll probably will not
                    see you for a period of time. But always know I’m there for
                    you if you need me.
                </p>
                <h3>Freelancing</h3>
                <p>
                    Freelancing! Yes, I love freelancing. It’s the grey area
                    between working an office job and having a whole business.
                    That’s because I’m the boss, but I’m also the employee. It’s
                    nice to start freelancing the proper way, and I’m glad to
                    have worked with multiple companies for a short period
                    between June to October. Being in NS doesn’t help with the
                    momentum at all, but I’m sure I can find clients that are
                    happy to work with me during my free time on weekends (hell
                    yeah to self-belief and confidence!)
                </p>
                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>
                    Family. The scary F word. I feel like I’m not as close to my
                    family as compared to what I see from my friends or even on
                    the internet. But then I realised that those are only the
                    good parts. 2018 has been the year I got much closer to my
                    family, where I shared more things rather than keeping
                    everything to myself. I shared with them about my work, my
                    goals, and even the name of my ex-date! Talking to my
                    parents about personal stuff aren’t that scary as I thought.
                    It’s mostly the overthinking in our heads that prevent us
                    from starting the conversation proper. I’m also glad to be
                    spending more time with my baby cousins, as well as their
                    parents, and my same-aged cousins. Although I’m not very
                    close to them, I know they’re always there by my side to
                    help me with anything. I hope to see them succeed too.
                </p>
                <h3>Friends</h3>
                <p>
                    Friends. Who doesn’t have friends? I thought I didn’t have
                    any when I was in secondary school all the way until I went
                    to NP and joined this CCA called Stage 52. I probably made
                    my lifetime friends there. The funny thing is, our
                    personalities are so diverse. I’m the only Malay there. It’s
                    weird, but it’s also very comforting, because I’m not
                    pressured to speak in Malay, which I’m really bad at. We
                    went to Penang together and had an extremely good time. I
                    expected a 9/10 experience. It was closer to 20/10. When I’m
                    in an extremely depressing state, they’re always there to
                    help me. Although I lost a lot of friends that I regularly
                    hang out with, I do hope for success upon their lives too.
                    My secondary school friends still mean a lot to me, and even
                    though I don’t meet them often (maybe even less than 5 times
                    a year), I hope Allah bless them and their family, and
                    hopefully they don’t forget me as well. There are others
                    that I appreciate a lot too, don’t be discouraged if I
                    didn’t mention you here.

                <h3>National Service</h3>
                <p>
                    The 2 scariest words. National Service (NS). Oh, my, NS.
                    Such an amazing, at the same time, awful place. I’m 10 weeks
                    in and I still haven’t passed out. Because I am as what they
                    label it, 'Obese'. So I have to work out and burn these fats
                    and reach a healthy BMI. Other than the damning duration, NS
                    has been really fun and enjoyable for the most part. My bunk
                    mates are freaking awesome, they’re so funny at the same
                    time so knowledgeable in everything. I lost a lot of weight
                    and got much, much fitter too. Although I kind of have the
                    feeling we won’t keep in touch as often after we pass out, I
                    do hope the best for them too. I know that not everyone is
                    meant to stay in our lives, and that’s totally fine. We have
                    a group of people meant for each other and I think the
                    people from NP are my group. At the time of posting, 69 days
                    to POP (Pass-Out Parade)!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I conclude this reflection, I would like to put up
                    some of my New Year’s Resolution here. I never do them, but
                    I think I have to for 2019 so I can hold myself accountable,
                    and people who read this can also remind me or ask me how
                    I’ve progressed.
                </p>
                <h3>Be Happier</h3>
                <p>
                    Definitely the most important. I have to be happier. To
                    reach that state I definitely have to have more self-belief,
                    more confidence, and get rid of my insecurities. I also
                    should pray more often, <em>Doa</em> (supplication) for a
                    happier soul and spending money on memories and experience
                    rather than materialistic things is a few ways to reach a
                    happier state too. Only when I’m happy can I work towards my
                    goals better.
                </p>
                <h3>Self-Improvement</h3>
                <p>
                    Hard skills or soft skills, it doesn’t matter. I have to
                    improve myself as a person. Train to be a leader, to be a
                    better speaker, get better at front-end development, be more
                    proficient in user experience design, learn a new language.
                    Religious-wise, pray more often, more supplications, and
                    more good deeds and actions, especially to people who needs
                    it. There’s ton of things that I can improve on. 2019 is the
                    year.
                </p>
                <h3>Appreciation</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s mandatory for me to appreciate things in my life more.
                    2018 was the year where I 'lost' a lot, and that’s when I
                    realised I never truly appreciated something until I lose
                    it. In 2019, I have to be much more appreciative, with
                    everything that I have. I believe that in Islam it’s
                    important for a Muslim to be appreciative of what he or she
                    has because only Allah have the power to take away
                    everything they have and leave them with nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there you have it. The most grammatically incorrect
                    reflection in the world. On a serious note, 2018 have been
                    an amazing year of lessons for me, and I wish for more in
                    2019, as well as a lot of happy times. To becoming a better
                    person, a better Muslim, and to a fruitful year.

                    P.S. This is a preview of my new portfolio site that will be
                    coming sometime end Q1 2019. It will be developed fully in
                    CSS Grid and Flexbox, using my own personal design system
                    and style guide, as well as the best practices for
                    typography, performance and more. It will be static site,
                    generated by Gatsby with React, and using GraphQL to fetch
                    dynamic data from CMS like Prismic or Contentful (probably
                    the former). I can't wait to show all of you who read this
                    post the website sometime in March! I wish I could publish
                    it faster but Static Site Generators are a totally new thing
                    for me and being in camp 5/7 days does not help at all. But
                    I promise it will look AMAZING end of March!
